## Hi, I'm Aishwarya! 👩‍💻

TL;DR: Software Engineer | iOS, Backend, Full-Stack Dev | Grad student exploring AI & ML

I’m a Software Engineer who loves turning ideas into reality through code! With hands-on experience in iOS, Backend, and Full-Stack Development, I enjoy building things that make a difference. These days, I’m diving into AI and ML as part of my grad studies, exploring how to build innovative, AI-powered products.

Currently, I'm also learning about Distributed Systems — focusing on building scalable, fault-tolerant, and reliable systems!

 - 💻 Languages I'm proficient in:  `Python`, `Java`, `Swift`, `JavaScript`
 - 🧰 ML Frameworks and libraries: PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, HuggingFace, MLflow
 - 🔭 A project I recently worked on: An [AI assistant for diagnosis](https://github.com/agirishkumar/MedScript) - I learnt about the lifecycle of machine learning models, how to build end-to-end machine learning pipelines, and use tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and GCP to deploy models
